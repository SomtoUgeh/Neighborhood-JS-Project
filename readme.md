# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

> Developed for my **Udacity Full stack  Nanodegree**. 🎓



This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare. 🔰


The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. Heck, the icons even bounce like you expect them to. 🗺

There's also extra info pulled from the Foursquare API where available. This includes website URLs and phone numbers. ☎️

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS grids and media queries. 

It can also recalibrate itself based on your screen size. Try resizing the window! 🖥 📲

# How to Run the Application
1. Download the src code from the repo or git clone it to your local machine.
2. Unzip the folder it is in.
3. Open the folder in an Text-editor, preferably Webstorm by JetBrains (Cause I like them).
4. open the index.html file in a browser
5. Feel free to go through the code and digest it


# How To Use
1. Type in the search bar on the side to find a particular location 
2. Click on any of the places on the map / sidebar for more information
